# NoticeBoard

This is a desktop application project developed using C++/QT/Linux.

I am developing this project in order to help the users so that they
can inform about what happened, and what's going, and what needs to be done,
to their other co-workers in an hourly shift environment like 
hotels, hospitals, gas-stations, and other places.
