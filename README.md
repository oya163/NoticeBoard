# NoticeBoard

This is a desktop application project developed using C++/QT/Linux.

I am developing this project in order to help the hourly workers so that they
can inform about what happened, and what's going, and what needs to be done,
to their other co-workers in an hourly shift environment like 
hotels, hospitals, gas-stations, and other places.

In order to use this project,
you just need to change the database path (in homewindow.h) to your path
and create the tables (as in database_outline file),
then build it.
